    <p>
      Lamentations 5, like other chapters, has the same number of stanzas, 22,
      as the Hebrew alphabet.
      But unlike the other chapters:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        it lacks an acrostic structure (but see below)
      </li>
      <li>
        its <i>qinah</i> three-two stress pattern is less consistent;
        many of its stanzas have a three-three pattern.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Even, it would appear, the toehold of sanity provided by those features has evaporated.
    </p>
    <p>
      But is it really so barren?  Or may that, itself, be a point?
      Might there be something else in that loss and barrenness that drives us,
      like the original writers and hearers, deeper?
    </p>
    <p>
      Many attempts have been made to find something comparable to the acrostic.
      In the final four verses,
      taking not only the first but also the final letter of each
      (an "acrostic-telestic")
      yields the eight-letter Hebrew phrase "your God is exalted greatly".<sup>[1]</sup>
      While initially such praise looks a misfit in the context of devastation
      it nevertheless resonates well with the book of Job and its
      <i>"The <span class="yhwh">Lord</span> gives and the <span class="yhwh">Lord</span> takes away;
      bless&egrave;d be the name of the <span class="yhwh">Lord</span>"</i> (Job&nbsp;1:21).
      Further, this provides the otherwise missing "seventh acrostic"
      (the other six being one each in chapters 1, 2 and 4,
      plus the triple acrostic of chapter 3) and yielding that 
      creation-derived and sabbath-reflecting "six+one" of completion.
    </p>
    <p>
      How might we represent that?
      Perhaps "Alleluia",
      itself directly from the Hebrew "Hallelujah"
      ("Praise the <span class="yhwh">Lord</span>"),
      might be appropriate.

	  <sup>[2]</sup>There now starts a catalogue of what, in modern-day writing,
            we would call bullet points, 
            that returns at v.17 "<i>At all this...</i>".
        </p>
        <p>
	  <sup>[3]</sup>This might mean either the heat of the desert sun
            or tribes preying on desert refugees.
        </p>
        <p>
	  <sup>[4]</sup>Originally "jackals", but hyenas are more familiar,
            and this allows the poetic force of alliteration.
        </p>
        <p>
	  <sup>[5]</sup>The "<i>indeed</i>" translation is supported by both
            NABRE and Robert Alter.
	    Other versions also have this as statement
	    (KJV: "<i>but thou hast...</i>"; NEB: "<i>but if thou hast...then indeed</i>").
            The NIV can't stomach this: a begging "<i>unless you have...</i>". 
        </p>
        <p>
	  <sup>[6]</sup>This is an astonishingly grim ending;
	    we do well to meditate on this closure.
            In Jewish tradition,
            there is a convention of then repeating v.21
            ("<i>Lead us back... turn back to you</i>") as a coda.
