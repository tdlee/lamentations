    <p>
      This second poem leaves no doubt of the horrifying prospect that God himself is the antagonist: that he has turned against his own Daughter Zion.
      She in consequence considers the horrifying prospect of cannibalising her own infants (2:20, repeated at 4:10).
      Bookended, "A&nbsp;to&nbsp;Z", by "the day of the <span class="yhwh">Lord</span>'s anger",
      this is the nightmare-turned-reality incarnation of the prophet's warning,
        <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=amos+5%3A18-20&version=NRSVUE" target="_blank">Amos&nbsp;5:18&ndash;20</a>;
      it is the polar opposite of the psalmist's praise,
        <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+118%3A24-29&version=NRSVUE" target="_blank">Ps.&nbsp;118:24&ndash;27</a>.
      The poem has some striking similarities with the psalmist's lament,
        <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+89%3A38-45&version=NRSVUE" target="_blank">Ps.&nbsp;89:38&ndash;45</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the Hebrew text, the first eleven verses and the lines within them
      almost all start with verbs.<?php
        Footnote('This includes even the very opening itself if, as the rhythm suggests, the opening "Alas!" is treated as an outlying anacrusis.')
      ?>
      This bombarding effect is counter
      to the English-language "subject then verb" convention.
      That sustained, pounding drive is conveyed here
      by using a verb-fronted, list-like structure for the first few verses,
      with the subject being relegated to less prominent placement.
      For example the first three verses may be read as:
    <div class="panel panel--width-18em">
      <div class="poem poem__hebverse">
        <p>
          <span class="acrostic-letter">A</span>las! Angered, the Lord:<br>
            &mdash;beclouded&hellip;<br>
            &mdash;flung down&hellip;<br>
            &mdash;nor remembered&hellip;<br>
            &mdash;<span class="acrostic-letter">b</span>litzed to the ground&hellip;<br>
            &mdash;razed in fury&hellip;<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          The Lord has:<br>
            &mdash;devoured&hellip;<br>
            &mdash;<span class="acrostic-letter">c</span>ut off&hellip;<br>
            &mdash;withdrawn&hellip;<br>
            &mdash;blazed&hellip;<br>
        </p>
      </div><!-- "poem" -->
    </div><!-- "panel" -->

    <p>
      The first poem was in two "voices", approximately 50&ndash;50: a witness-bystander and Daughter Zion herself. This second poem is mostly voiced by the witness, but at 19 the witness can be seen to implore the city herself to voice her complaint, which she accordingly does to close the poem.
