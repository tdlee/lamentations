          Alas!<sup>[1]</sup> In his anger my Lord beclouded<br>
          &emsp;Daughter Zion;<br>
          flung down from the heavens to earth<br>
          &emsp;the honour of Israel;<br>
          nor remembered his footstool<sup>[2]</sup><br>
          &emsp;in the day of his anger;

          Brought to the ground in desecration<br>
          &emsp;a kingdom and its princes;<br>
          in fury has razed the defences<br>
          &emsp;of Daughter Judah.<br>
          My Lord has devoured without pity<br>
          &emsp;all the dwellings of Jacob;

        <div class="poem__verseref">3</div>

          Cut off in his smouldering wrath<br>
          &emsp;every horn of Israel;<br>
          has withdrawn his right hand<br>
          &emsp;at enemy approach;<br>
          has blazed against Jacob in fire,<br>
          &emsp;consuming all around.

          Drawing his bow like an enemy,<br>
          &emsp;his right hand poised,<br>
          like a foe, he has slain those precious<br>
          &emsp;in his eye, and has poured<br>
          out his wrath like fire on the tent<br>
          &emsp;of Daughter Zion.

          Enemy! So the Lord has become,<br>
          &emsp;and swallowed up Israel&mdash;<br>
          has swallowed up all of her palaces,<br>
          &emsp;and laid waste her strongholds;<br>
          has multiplied for Daughter Judah<br>

          &emsp;law is absent;<sup>[4]</sup><br>
