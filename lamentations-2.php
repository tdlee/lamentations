          Alas!<sup>[1]</sup> The Lord in his anger<br>
          &emsp;abhorred daughter Zion;<br>
          flung down from the heavens to earth<br>
          &emsp;the splendour of Israel;<br>
          nor remembered his footstool<sup>[2]</sup><br>
          &emsp;in the day of his anger;

          Brought to the ground in dishonour<br>
          &emsp;a kingdom and its princes;<br>
          in fury has razed the defences<br>
          &emsp;of the daughter of Judah.<br>
          The Lord has devoured without pity<br>
          &emsp;all the dwellings of Jacob;

          Cut off in his smoldering wrath<br>
          &emsp;the horn of Israel;<br>
          has withdrawn his right hand<br>
          &emsp;at enemy approach;<br>
          then blazed against Jacob in fire,<br>
          &emsp;to scorched earth consuming.

          Directing his bow like an enemy,<br>
          &emsp;his right hand poised,<br>
          like a foe, he has slain those precious<br>
          &emsp;in his eye, and has poured<br>
          out his wrath like fire on the tent<br>
          &emsp;of the Daughter of Zion.

          Enemy! So the Lord has become,<br>
          &emsp;and swallowed up Israel&mdash;<br>
          has swallowed up all of her palaces,<br>
          &emsp;and laid waste her strongholds;<br>

          &emsp;both feast-day and sabbath;<br>
