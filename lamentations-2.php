    <p>
      This second poem leaves no doubt of the horrifying prospect that God himself is the antagonist: that he has turned against his own Daughter Zion.
      She in consequence considers the horrifying prospect of cannibalising her own infants (2:20, repeated at 4:10).
      It recounts God's anger being unleashed on her;
      one commentator identifies within just the first eight verses
      as many as 27 terms of anger about the <span class="yhwh">Lord</span>'s destructive force.<?php Footnote('Berman (2023), p.58.'); ?>
      It concludes in turn with her anger being unleashed towards God.<?php
        Footnote('Hens-Piazza (2017), p.xliii.');
      ?>
    </p>

        $fn='This is just one component of a chiastic structure across this chapter.
          Other components include the resonance of the opening and closing verbs
          ("angered"/"beclouded" and "annihilated") and the "horn" motif.';
      ?>
      Bookended, "A&nbsp;to&nbsp;Z", by "the day of the <span class="yhwh">Lord</span>'s anger",<?php Footnote($fn); ?>
      this is the nightmare-turned-reality incarnation of the prophet's warning,
        <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=amos+5%3A18-20&version=NRSVUE" target="_blank">Amos&nbsp;5:18&ndash;20</a>;
      it is the polar opposite of the psalmist's praise,
        <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+118%3A24-29&version=NRSVUE" target="_blank">Ps.&nbsp;118:24&ndash;27</a>.
      The poem has some striking similarities with the psalmist's lament,
        <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+89%3A38-45&version=NRSVUE" target="_blank">Ps.&nbsp;89:38&ndash;45</a>.<?php
          Footnote('For these references see Goldingay (2022): p.91 (Amos); p.111 (Ps.118);  p.89 (Ps.89).');
        ?>
    </p>

    <p>
      Observe the "pitiless"/"without pity" thread in vv.2, 17 and 21 (also 3:43).<?php Footnote('Dobbs-Allsopp (1997), p.49.'); ?>
      Observe, too, the even more savage "devour" thread in vv.2, 5 (twice) 8 and 16.<?php Footnote('Provan (2016), p.57.'); ?>
      There is a final, vile twist at v.20.
      Women are cannibalising their children because the Lord has devoured his people.<?php
        Footnote('Hens-Piazza (2017), pp.34&ndash;35.');
      ?>
    </p>

    <p>
      In the Hebrew text, over 80% of this poem's verses,
      1&ndash;11 and 15&ndash;21, start with verbs.<?php
        Footnote('This includes even the very opening itself if, as the rhythm suggests, the opening "Alas!" is treated as an outlying anacrusis.')
      ?>
      And additionally, within those verses,
      many of their internal couplets are similarly verb-fronted.
      In English this can be seen strikingly in
      <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=lamentations+2&version=YLT" target="_blank">Young's Literal Translation</a>
      from the late nineteenth century.<?php
        Footnote('Young\'s Literal Translation is able to do this reasonably accurately because, unlike this version, it is not constrained by attempting either <i>qinah</i> or alphabetic acrostics. That said, of course, this poetry-led version attempts to retain this linguistic feature where possible.');
      ?>
      This bombarding effect is counter
      to the English-language "subject then verb" convention.
      That sustained, pounding drive is conveyed here
      by using a verb-fronted, list-like structure for the first few verses,
      with the subject being relegated to less prominent placement.
      For example the first three verses may be read as:

      The first poem had been in two "voices", approximately 50&ndash;50:
      a witness-reporter and Daughter Zion herself.
      This second poem is mostly voiced by the reporter,
      until at 18&ndash;19 the reporter can be seen to implore the city
      to voice her complaint, which she accordingly does to close the poem.
      Yet in the midst of their initially objective reportage,
      the reporter switches to an engaged present-tense at v10,<?php Footnote('Berman (2023), p.67.'); ?>
      breaking down and speaking subjectively of their own personal response
      in a soliloquy, 11&ndash;17, that interrrupts their graphic portrayal of the violence
      and seeks, however vainly, to comfort Jerusalem.<?php Footnote('Middlemas (2021), p.94.'); ?>
      And the likely trigger for the observer's change of stance in v11?
      Here is where the tortured, lingering deaths of infants and children,
      the innocents, are witnessed, with their own mothers agonisingly helpless.<?php
        Footnote('Hens-Piazza (2017), pp.25&ndash;26.');
      ?>
      "Who could heal you?"&nbsp;(v13). The only possible healer is God,
      but God is the very one ravaging her in the first place.<?php
        Footnote('O\'Connor (2002), p.38.');
