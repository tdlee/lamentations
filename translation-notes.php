    <h2>Translation? Or something else?</h2>

    <p>
      I would like to call this a translation.
      But that opens up the thorny question of that term's definition.
      Getting hung up on the term itself would probably only take us down a long, dark rabbit-hole to a dead end.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have endeavoured to use the principles of translation.
      But whereas in the secular world translation of ancient poetry
      allows some freedom to include considerations of poetic features,
      biblical translation, by contrast, almost invariably treats all texts,
      even overtly poetic texts, as prose
      where accurate dictionary-equivalence is paramount;
      it makes relatively minor allowance for poetic form.

    <p>
      That creates a tension here in Lamentations, which is strongly poetic.
      And this translation emphasises this inherent, structural poetry as a defining characteristic.
      Certainly, the acrostic, including its 'A' and 'Z' endpoints, is key.
      Equally key is the underlying rhythm:
      that driving 3&ndash;2 <i>qinah</i> rhythm of the first four chapters.
      To the best of my knowledge no other translation of Lamentations has both.
    </p>

    <p>
      So is it a translation?  A paraphrase?  A version?  A rendering?  Let the reader decide.
    </p>

    <h2>Guiding principles</h2>

          A personal note
        </div>
        <p>
          As readers we inevitably import, subconsciously or otherwise,
          our own perspectives. These influence our interpretation.
          The same applies to translators.
          <span lang="it"><em>Traduttore, traditore</em></span>:
          "To translate is to betray [some aspect of the original]."
        </p>
        <p>
          My own background, hence implicit perspective,
          is rooted in lifelong Christian faith,
          and towards the evangelical
          region of that range
          (although at arm's length from some of fundamentalism's excesses).
          When my Christian hymn-writing
          turns to setting of the pre-Christian psalms,
          there I further had to learn the importance
          of reading such Old Testament texts
          with their pre-Christian original intent,
          and to be alert to potential imposition of
          our subsequent Christian theology.
        </p>
        <p>
          In preparing this version of Lamentations,
          I have very consciously attempted to avoid imposing
          any Christian colouration over the text.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also have no knowledge whatsoever of the Hebrew language.
          So this has been a crash course in at least becoming aware of
          various linguistic features usually little considered by
          lay readers of English:
          concepts such as "precative perfect" which so influences, for instance, 3:55&ndash;63,
          and terms such as <em>qatal</em> and <em>yiqtol</em>.
        </p>

      </div><!-- "panel" -->

    <!-- panel -->

    <p>
      The alphabetic acrostic is central.  The <i>qinah</i> rhythm is central.
      But what about the text?
    </p>

    <p>
      Hebrew poetry tends not to do rhyme.
      To add rhyme here, despite its prevalence in English poetry and hymnody,
      would gain very little, and would force far more constraint than is necessary.
      Accordingly this version makes no attempt at rhyme.
      Indeed, on a couple of occasions,
      the drafting process accidentally produced rhyme;
      I then specifically redrafted in order to avoid its distraction.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Hebrew poetry <em>does</em> make quite frequent use of wordplay.
      Sometimes, something similar can be done in English translation;
      alliteration can be useful here.
    </p>

    <p>
      Both Hebrew and English use metaphor.
      Where reasonably possible, this is conveyed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Often, subtle aspects of wordplay are untranslatable;
      see for example 1:3 and 2:20 and their footnotes.
    </p>

    <h2>Qinah</h2>

    <p>
      <em>Qi<u>nah</u> or <u>not</u> qi<u>nah</u>? <u>That</u> is the <u>ques</u>tion.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      Most biblical scholarship is agreed beyond reasonable doubt
      that the 3&ndash;2 <i>qinah</i> beat is prevalent in the first four chapters.
      But there is lively debate about particular details in particular verses.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, the opening "Alas!" verse of the first chapter,
      and probably also of the second, may be seen as 4&ndash;2.
      Accordingly some of the rhythmically alert translations
      set that single-beat "Alas!" as a separate anacrusis.
      This version, too, adopts that practice.
    </p>

    <p>
      Much of this gnat-straining debate will almost certainly never be unambiguously or satisfactorily resolved.
      In view of that, I simply endeavour to use <i>qinah</i> as consistently as possible in these chapters.
      This also helps highlight the contrast on entering chapter&nbsp;5,
      where there is reasonable agreement that its rhythm is mostly non-<i>qinah</i>, generally 3&ndash;3.<? Footnote('Berlin (2004), p.117; Goldingay (2022), p.190.'); ?>
    </p>

    <h2>Acrostic challenges</h2>

    <p>
      Acrostics constrain the choice of a verse's opening word.
      Sometimes there simply isn't an English word anywhere near suitable.
      Different cases require different approaches
      and these are usually mentioned in footnotes.
      A few are also given in a little more detail below.
    </p>

    <p>
      One possibility is to swap lines within a verse.
      A case in point is 1:7 whose first line requires an opening 'G' word.
      A workable solution is to switch its first and second lines,
      allowing for "goodly treasures" to begin the verse.
      But a chapter later at 2:7 a similar problem arises,
      and also, as it happens, with a 'G' verse.
      Here, too, a similar line-swap solution offered itself.
      This was tempting.
      But other factors argued against its adoption,
      despite the fact that it would solve an additional problem.
      See the footnote there.
    </p>

    <p>
      The acrostic use of 'Z' for the final stanza of the first four poems
      is an interesting challenge, as there are so few such English words
      in regular use.
      The third poem in particular requires the use of three such words.
      These must all be different, to reflect the Hebrew 'tav' words being different.
    </p>

    <p>
      Conversely, the third poem's ninth stanza,
      Hebrew letter 'tet', verses 25&ndash;27,
      requires a single word used three times,
      ideally meaning "good".
      But "good" is not available to us,
      as 'G' is the seventh letter in our alphabet, and we are at 'I' (ninth letter).
      "Irreproachable" seems a moderately acceptable choice, with not too much semantic compromise,
      although its five syllables rather than one pull against our desired linguistic compactness.
      Fortunately, the overall acrostic requirement to omit four letters also makes 'J' (tenth letter) a possibility.
      This allows for "judicious", which seems better both semantically and in having only three syllables.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the triple acrostic at 3:43&ndash;45
      the first two verses have noticeably similar structures,
      both leading with a powerfully pictorial verb meaning "cover", "veil", "screen" or "envelop".
      At this point we need an 'R' word, but there is no readily apparent such verb,
      nor is there another word suitably shareable across them both.
      So the unusual, but clear "re-cloak" was used.
      While its "re-" prefix suggests a concept of recurrence
      which is not apparent in the original verbs,
      nevertheless it hints back to ideas to which the wider context
      of those verses seems to allude.
      See the footnote there.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the positive side, our 26 letters over Hebrew's 22
      means we can drop four English letters.
      This provides some flexibility.
      'X' is an obvious candidate.  'Z' would also have been,
      but our strong desire for that sense  of "A&nbsp;to&nbsp;Z" totality
      requires its retention and inclusion.
    </p>

    <h3>A thematic example</h3>

    <p>
      There are a few cases of words being repeated within a poem,
      and in some cases across them.
      I try to retain these.
    </p>

    <p>
      The verbs "look" and "notice" recur, sometimes in emphatic pairing.
      Other English verbs would have been candidates: "see", "behold", "observe" etc.
      But our acrostic requirement drives the choice,
      particularly at 1:12,
      which has to be at, or very close to, alphabetic 'N'.
      A typical good, but non-acrostic translation is the <abbr title="New Revised Standard Version">NRSV</abbr>:
    </p>

    <div class="panel panel--width-22em">
      <div class="poem poem__hebverse">
        <div class="poem__versetext">
          <div class="indent0">Is it nothing to you, all you who pass by?</div>
          <div class="indent1">Look and see</div>
          <div class="indent0">if there is any sorrow like my sorrow,</div>
          <div class="indent1">which was brought upon me,</div>
          <div class="indent0">which the <span class="yhwh">Lord</span> inflicted</div>
          <div class="indent1">on the day of his fierce anger.</div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="panel__cite">
          &mdash;Lam.1:12, NRSV
      </div><!-- "panel__cite" -->
    </div>

    <p>
      The obvious acrostic-leading 'N'-word would be that "nothing" in the first part of the first couplet.
      Despite that, there seems no decent, readable means to re-organise the couplet
      to start with "<span class="acrostic-letter">N</span>othing&hellip;" or similar.
      But its second part is "look and see".
      This would allow the 'N'-word "<span class="acrostic-letter">N</span>otice"
      and presents a possible way forward:
    </p>

    <div class="panel panel--width-22em">
      <div class="poem poem__hebverse">
        <div class="poem__verse">
          <div class="poem__versetext">
              <div class="indent0 acrostic-line">Notice! And look, you passers-by;</div>
              <div class="indent2">is it nothing to you?</div>
              <div class="indent1">Is there any&hellip;</div>
          </div><!-- poem__versetext -->
        </div><!-- poem__verse -->
      </div><!-- "poem" -->
    </div><!-- "panel" -->

    <p>
      But there is more.
      The verbs and their frequent pairing present a recurrent theme,
      not only within the first chapter but across other chapters.
      So when locking in the acrostic  "<span class="acrostic-letter">N</span>otice"
      these, too, must be considered.
      The run up to that 1:12 prepares the way:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>
      1:9<i>c</i>: &hellip;<strong>Look</strong>, O&nbsp;<span class="yhwh">Lord</span>: my affliction&hellip;
    </li>
    <li>
      1:11<i>c</i>: &hellip;<strong>Look</strong>, O&nbsp;<span class="yhwh">Lord</span>, and <strong>notice</strong>&hellip;
    </li>
    <li>
      1:12: <strong>Notice!</strong> And <strong>look</strong>, you passers-by&hellip;
    </li>
    <li>
      1:20: &hellip;<span class="yhwh">Lord</span>; <strong>look!</strong>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Then observe that 2:20 uses it,
      and even more that the final poem almost opens with that same pair of verbs.
      The "notice" root also puts in an appearance at 3:63 and 4:16,
      and "look" at 2:16 and 3:36:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>
      2:16: we have lived to <strong>look</strong> upon it
    </li>
    <li>
      2:20: &hellip;<strong>Look</strong>, <span class="yhwh">Lord</span>; <strong>notice</strong>&hellip;
    </li>
    <li>
      3:36: does our Lord not <strong>look?</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
      3:63: You <strong>notice?</strong>&hellip;
    </li>
    <li>
      4:16: &hellip;no more does he <strong>notice</strong> them.
    </li>
    <li>
      5:1: &hellip;<strong>look</strong>; <strong>notice</strong> our disgrace&hellip;
    </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Further, <strong>look</strong> also lies behind 3:1
      where the Hebrew verb carries the additional nuance of "to experience, know",
      important to this instance of its use.<?php Footnote('Dobbs-Allsopp (2012), p.111.'); ?>
      The man's opening use of the verb follows hard on the heels of Daughter Zion's
      commanding use of it at 2:20 in her brief but devastating speech.
      But the lack of an equivalent English verb which would clearly carry this additional meaning
      (it would be something like "I am the man who has looked [squarely] at affliction")
      makes it impractical to pursue this idea.
      The additional requirements
      of the acrostic (which tends to expand the line),
      and of the <i>qinah</i> rhythm (which needs to constrain the line)
      conspire to put its incorporation beyond reach.
    </p>

    <p>
      But underlying all this consideration of <strong>notice</strong> and <strong>look</strong>
      was the requirement at 1:12 for a leading acrostic 'N'-word.<?php
        Footnote('Ideally, the leading verb at 3:59 and 60, which are W-acrostic, would also be included here.  But that was a stretch too far, so I used the visual near-synonym "witness".');
      ?>
    </p>

    <h3>A sad impossibility</h3>

    <p>
      The 3:25&ndash;27 stanza also highlights an issue
      masked by a quirk of the English lanuguage itself.
      Its acrostic word, usually translated "good",
      is then repeated in comparative form as the acrostic word at 4:9
      which deems sword-impalement to be "better" (i.e. "more good").
      Had the English comparative of "good" been "gooder"
      then the reader, indeed the worshipper, would be struck by something like:
    </p>

    <div class="panel panel--width-35em">
      <div class="poem poem__hebverse">
        <div class="poem__verseref">3:25</div>
        <div class="poem__versetext">
            <div class="indent0 acrostic-line">Good is the <span class="yhwh">Lord</span>&hellip;;</div>
        </div>
        <div class="poem__verseref">3:26</div>
        <div class="poem__versetext">
            <div class="indent0 acrostic-line">Good when one waits quietly&hellip; for the <span class="yhwh">Lord</span>'s salvation;</div>
        </div>
        <div class="poem__verseref">3:27</div>
        <div class="poem__versetext">
            <div class="indent0 acrostic-line">Good for a man to bear a yoke in his youth.</div>
            <div class="indent0">&hellip;</div>
        </div>

        <div class="poem__versetext">

        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      An almost shocking: "The <span class="yhwh">Lord</span> is good
      but both sword-piercing and famine-piercing are on the same 'goodness' scale."
      This seems missed by even the commentators.

      -->
    </p>

    <p>
      Alas, translating this Hebrew-acrostic resonance across these two poems
      seems almost insuperable in the English language
      and beyond reach in our version with its additional constraints of
      <i>qinah</i>-compactness and the English-acrostic.<?php
        Footnote('This acrostic resonance would seem to be further reinforced
          by the double use of "impaling" within 4:9');
      ?>
    </p>

    <h2>Word choices</h2>

    <p>
      Lamentations was written in contemporary language of its day.
      Accordingly this version sometimes uses words and terms that are relatively modern in our own day,
      or that have a modern edge.
      Examples include: "zero in" (1:22), "blitzed" (2:2), "hell-bent" (2:8), "slow-clap" (2:15), "snide-song" (3:63), "zilch" (3:64), "ziplock" (3:65), "firestorm" (4:11), "boozed" (4:21), "no-go zones" (4:18), "up to our necks" (5:5).
      And "ranked" (4:2) also now carries an appropriate modern slant of disdain.
    </p>

    <p>
      Meanwhile the verb "zoned" (2:22) is old, whose meanings include "encircle".
    </p>

    <h3>YHWH, Adonai, <span class='yhwh'>Lord</span> and Lord</h3>

    <p>
      Most English translations face the issue of representing
      two closely related but different Hebrew words that name God:
      "YHWH" and "Adonai".
      This has considerations both for writing/reading and for recitation.
      Alter's 2018 translation writes, respectively, "<span class='yhwh'>Lord</span>" and "Master".
    </p>

    <p>
      Jewish custom avoids saying the Divine Name "YHWH",
      instead saying the other word "Adonai".<?php
        Footnote('Sometimes "HaShem", "the Name", is pronounced.');
      ?>
      This results in recitation using a single, common word to pronounce
      two different underlying words.
      Representing "YHWH" as "Yahweh" or, worse, "Jehovah"
      seems unsatisfactory in a version designed for recitation,
      And representing "Adonai" as "Master" seems unsatisfactory
      because it is outside normal Christian practice.<?php
        Footnote('More precisely the English title "Master" is almost never used
          about God in our Old Testament or (except for a couple of instances)
          in the New Testament outside the gospels; its use is restricted
          to the disciples in the gospels addressing Jesus of Nazareth.
          Similarly its use in Christian worship is exceedingly rare:
          an example is the Prayer of St.&nbsp;Francis.');
      ?>
      Some English translations bring "Sovereign" into play,
      especially when the Hebrew is "Adonai YHWH",
      which becomes "Sovereign <span class='yhwh'>Lord</span>".
      But in Lamentations that double term doesn't appear,
      so we needn't consider that slightly awkward wording.
    </p>

    <p>
      So the approach taken here
      is firstly to adopt the usual present-day practice of writing
      "YHWH" as "<span class='yhwh'>Lord</span>" (small capitals)
      and "Adonai" as "Lord" (normal case).
      And then because "Adonai" generally appears in a grammatically possessive context,
      it is secondarily here represented as "<em>my</em> Lord" or "<em>our</em> Lord",
      so that the subtle written difference is also audibly present in recitation.<?php
        Footnote('"Much Ado about Nothing"?
          Reducing further the concern about such detail
          is that one of the earliest Hebrew witnesses,
          Dead Sea Scrolls 4QLam,
          itself shows some variation of YHWH/Adonai usage
          from the authoritative but later Masoretic Text. Kotz&eacute; (2011), p.115.')
      ?>
    </p>

    <h3>Daughter Zion</h3>

    <p>
      Central to chapters&nbsp;1 and 2 is "Daughter Zion" ("Daughter Jerusalem").
      The "Daughter&nbsp;X" metaphor extends across all the first four chapters
      with "Daughter Judah" and "Daughter People".
      In chapter&nbsp;4 it is given a further, but sarcastic, twist
      of <i><span lang="de">schadenfreude</span></i>
      with "Daughter Edom".
    </p>

    <p>
      Yet this seemingly simple form of wording, in Hebrew <em>bat Tzion</em>,
      is notoriously difficult to translate across
      from Ancient Near East cultures into modern Western cultures.
      Many older translations had opted for "Daughter&nbsp;<em>of</em> X".
    </p>

    <p>
      Perhaps the majority of recent translations and commentators specifically avoid the inserted English "of".
      There seems a widely agreed recognition that this grammatical construction
      is a conceptual metaphor,
      yielding multiple meanings for God's relationship to the people, the land, and the Temple at its sacred centre,
      and is not to be understood in the sense of daughter <em>of</em> Zion, but rather in the sense of Zion <em>as</em> daughter.<?php Footnote('Adelman (2021).'); ?>
      This is not merely a secular-usage "Land of X" or "City of X" or "People of X";
      rather, all these concepts are wrapped together, and in relationship to God, as "Daughter X".
      Further, an attempt to retain "of" stretches to breaking point
      of unnecessary obscurity
      in what would have to become "Daughter [of my] People" (2:11, 3:48, 4:3,6,10).
    </p>

    <p>
      With the "Daughter" (<em>bat</em>) component, most translations keep this.
      Nevertheless some commentators use other words for illustration,
      not least to reflect, in their context of study, that the Hebrew <em>bat Tzion</em>
      has a wider semantic range than its English representation "Daughter Zion".
      Further, the sense of endearment in "daughter" also varies among commentators. Adelman (2021) and Berlin (2004), p.12, endorse it;  Goldingay (2022), p.60, downplays it.
    </p>

    <p>
      A few examples.
      The NIV has "Daughter X" (upper-case 'D');
      the NABBRE and NIV (also Provan (2016), p.41) have "daughter X" (lower-case 'd');
      Berlin (2004) has "Dear X" (which heightens the sarcasm in chapter&nbsp;4's "Dear Edom");
      Hens-Piazza (2017) writes about "Woman Zion";
      Goldingay (2022) has "Ms.&nbsp;Zion" (Miss/Mistress);
      Berman (2023) writes about "Bat-Zion".
      Those recent versions which omit the "of" generally capitalise "Daughter" (or their equivalent word),
      making it a proper noun, with a sense not merely of description but also of title.

      This version,
      with its slants towards recovery of the original poetry and to present-day dramatic usage (including worship contexts),
      specifically follows the "Daughter X" route.<?php
        Footnote('As a beneficial side-effect
          this short-form "Daughter X" can occasionally aid recitation
          where strong <i>qinah</i> beats are a scarce commodity.
          While "<strong>daugh</strong>ter Je<strong>ru</strong>salem" still normally uses two beats,
          it can be eased into a single beat (e.g. "daughter Je<strong>ru</strong>salem")
          if necessary.');
      ?>
      In a couple of instances the pervasive challenge of the acrostic constraint
      have necessitated an inversion
      from "Daughter Jerusalem" to "Jerusalem-Daughter" (2:10)
      and from "Daughter Zion" to "Zion-Daughter" (4:22).
    </p>

    <h3>Sit/lodge/lie: a worked example</h3>

    <p>
      The very first line "[Alas!] Alone she sits:&hellip;" ignites a translational ambiguity in vocabulary.
      The original verb may be legitimately represented as 'sit', 'abide', 'lodge', 'reside' or 'lie'.
      But no single English verb naturally embraces this range.
      From the very start of this version, I had opted for "Alone she lies"
      (a) reasoning (with hindsight, weakly) that in English
      we tend to think of a city as "lying" rather than "sitting" in a landscape
      and (b) liking the alone/lies alliteration.
      But almost immediately at 1:3 a problem arose
      in describing the exiled, deported populace
      which would be "she lies [among the nations]".
      So I used a different but nonetheless alliterative verb "she lodges [among the nations]".
      I left it at that, having become perhaps over-attached to 1:1 'lies',
      and despite knowing full well the importance of poetic resonance
      across the text as a word recurs in different contexts.
    </p>

    <p>
      A long time later, I began to notice that same Hebrew verb
      (although often obscured in existing English translations)
      recurring elsewhere, particularly:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        3:28: at almost the centre of the book, applied to the man/<em>geber</em><?php Footnote ('Goldingay (2022), p.143.'); ?>
        which suggests a posture of 'sitting' rather than 'lying'
      </li>
      <li>
        4:21: applied in a sarcastic context to the enemy Daughter Edom<?php Footnote('Dobbs-Allsopp (2012), p.137.'); ?>
      </li>
      <li>
        5:19: at almost the very end,
        and in a repetition and implied resonance
        astonishingly overlooked by almost all translations,
        applied to God himself, where a late revision specifically to handle this
        was about to become
        "And you, <span class="yhwh">Lord</span>, forever lie [enthroned]".
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Surely this threaded repetition of the verb
      was intentional by the original author(s) and editor(s).
      While translation inevitably forces some compromises in some places,
      this instance seems too important to fudge,
      particularly in our avowedly poetically-driven framework.
    </p>

    <p>
      But in this 5:19 case, I immediately realised that
      in saying of God that he "forever lies"
      creates a new problem of ambiguity,
      this time within English: "God forever [tells] lies".
      However unintentional, this would clearly be unsatisfactory!
    </p>

    <p>
      As a result, I reworked the verb across the text to become 'sit'.
    </p>

    <h3>Other examples</h3>

    <ul>
    <li>
      Chapters 2 and 4 share the verb "pour"/"disgorge" as a thread,
      internal to each and common across them,
      and absent from other chapters.
      But whereas "pour" suits chapter&nbsp;2 and "disgorge" suits chapter&nbsp;4,
      neither seems quite right for the other chapter,
      nor did any other verb seem right for both.
    </li>

    <li>
      Threading through the second chapter is a recurrent "earth".<?php Footnote('Dobbs-Allsopp (2012), p.93.'); ?>
      Most references are to the local ground of everyday life.
      But, as with the English language,
      Hebrew also lets "earth" carry the much wider meaning
      of the inhabited world.
      And in this chapter, two further uses, in verses 1 and 15,
      are not only to that wider context
      but additionally import resonance from God-given promises elsewhere in scripture:
      the Genesis&nbsp;1 creation narrative and the "joy of all earth" of Psalm&nbsp;48.
      Both instances suggest an existential threat to,
      and potential overturning of, God-given order and promise.
      Other English translations tend to overlook the overlap
      of the single-word, but double-meaning, "earth".
      In this version, it seemed important to maintain it.
    </li>

    <li>
      At 4:16 very few English translations capture this verse's use of "face" in the Hebrew.
      Even fewer capture its double use.
      <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=lamentations+4&version=YLT" target="_blank">Young's Literal Translation</a>
      and the <a href="https://biblehub.com/lsv/lamentations/4.htm" target="_blank">Literal Standard Version</a>
      are two notable exceptions.
      The Hebrew even reinforces this aspect by opening both couplets with "face":
      "[The] face&hellip; [the] faces&hellip;".
      Its absence from most English versions seems an astonishing omission,
      as the concept of "the face (or countenance) of the <span class="yhwh">Lord</span>"
      seems theologically important in the Torah.
      This version makes sure to include it.<?php
        Footnote('Alas, the acrostic constraint prevents its use to head the first line, so we instead position that repetition at the line ends.');
      ?>
    </li>

    <li>
      At 5:18, desolate Zion is vividly pictured as occupied by wild animals.
      Other translations variously use "foxes" or "jackals";
      ancient zoological classifications are sometimes ambiguous to us.
      Here, I use "haunt of hyenas", which maintains the broad zoological classification
      and allows the use of a suitably unsettling alliterative expression.
    </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Inclusive language</h2>

    <p>
      Contemporary writing and translations rightly veer towards inclusive language, such as preferring "humankind" for "mankind".
      In general, this version adopts that principle.
    </p>

    <p>
      Nevertheless, gender-specificity is a strong feature of some of the Lamentations poetry.
      The "Daughter Zion" and "Daughter Jerusalem" personalisation is integral to chapters 1 and 2.
      Similarly, the "strong man" characterisation recurs through chapter 3.
      In these contexts, attempting to downplay these characteristics
      would seem not only pointless but even counter-productive.
      Accordingly this version maintains this distinction.
    </p>

    <p>
      Particular points include:
    </p>

    <ul>
    <li>
      Chapter&nbsp;3 is primarily about the "strong man", Hebrew <i>geber</i>.
      But it also uses the Hebrew word <i>adam</i> which is
      rather like the English word "man",
      being sometimes generically human and sometimes male-specific.<?php
        Footnote('See, for example, the near-adjacent uses in Genesis.
          Gen.1:27 is the generic
          "God created <i>adam</i>:&hellip; male and female he created them".
          Gen 2:7 is the male-specific
          "The <span class="yhwh">Lord</span> God formed <i>adam</i> from the dust of the ground",
          where the context prepares the way for the further creation of his female partner, Eve.');
      ?>
      Indeed, 3:39 uses both words.
      We translate <i>geber</i> as male-specific "man" (or similar)
      and <i>adam</i> as a generic "one" (or similar).
    </li>

    <li>
      At 4:1&ndash;2 "sons" is used to allow a carrying forward from the Hebrew
      of its "stones&hellip;sons" wordplay
      which is embedded in a larger-scale metaphor in those verses.
      See the footnote there.
