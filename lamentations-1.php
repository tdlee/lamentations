          Alas!<sup>[1]</sup> Solitary lies the city<br>
          &emsp;once teeming with people;<br>
          She, once great among nations,<br>
          &emsp;now become as a widow;<br>
          once queen among provinces,<br>
          &emsp;now chained to forced labour.

          Bitterly she weeps through the night<br>
          &emsp;her cheeks tear-wetted;<br>
          None there is to console her<br>
          &emsp;from all her lovers;<br>
          all of her friends have betrayed her,<br>
          &emsp;become her enemies.

          Cast out into exile is Judah;<br>
          &emsp;hard labour and affliction.<br>
          She dwells among other nations<br>
          &emsp;but finds no rest.<br>
          All who pursue her overtake her<br>
          &emsp;trapped down an alleyway.

          Devoid of all pilgrims to her feasts,<br>
          &emsp;the roads to Zion mourn;<br>
          her gateways all are desolate,<br>
          &emsp;her priests groan,<br>
          her young women grieve;<br>
          &emsp;how bitter her fate.

          Enemies now have mastered her,<br>
          &emsp;her foes rest easy.<br>
          The <span class="yhwh">Lord</span> has stricken her with sorrow<br>

          Her children are hauled into exile,<br>
          &emsp;captive before the foe.

          From Daughter Zion has departed<br>
          &emsp;all former splendour.<br>
          Her princes now wander like deer<br>
          &emsp;that find no pasture;<br>
          They run, all their strength spent,<br>
          &emsp;pursued by the hunter.

          Great treasures that once were hers<br>
          &emsp;in days gone by<br>
          Jerusalem calls to mind<br>
          &emsp;in her days of affliction.<br>
          When her people fell to enemy hand,<br>
          &emsp;there was none to help.<br>
          Her foes looked on and mocked<br>
          &emsp;her fallen state.<sup>[2]</sup>

          How greatly has Jerusalem sinned&mdash;<br>
          &emsp;become a mockery.<br>
          Those who once honoured her, despise her,<br>
          &emsp;seeing her nakedness.<br>
          She, on her part, groans<br>
          &emsp;and hides her face.

          Iniquity clung to her skirts;<br>
          &emsp;she heeded not her future.<br>
          Her downfall beggars belief;<br>
          &emsp;there was none to comfort her.<br>
          "Look, O <span class="yhwh">Lord</span> on my affliction,<br>

          &emsp;each one of her treasures;<br>
          nations of pagans she witnessed<br>
          &emsp;enter her sanctuary&mdash;<br>

          Notice! And look, you travellers;<br>
          &emsp;is it nothing to you?<br>
          Is there any pain like my pain,<br>
          &emsp;so inflicted on me,<br>
          that the <span class="yhwh">Lord</span> brought on me<br>
          &emsp;in the day of his wrath?

          Out of heaven he hurled fire;<br>
          &emsp;it ran through my bones.<br>
          He spread out a net for my feet;<br>
          &emsp;he turned me back.<br>
          He made me desolate; racked<br>
          &emsp;with sickness the day long.

        <div class="poem__verseref">14</div>
        <p>
          Packed into a yoke are my sins;<br>
          &emsp;his own hand wove them<br>
          and hoisted them onto my neck;<br>
          &emsp;my strength failed the weight.<br>
          He delivered me over to those<br>
          &emsp;I cannot withstand.

          Rejecting my own mighty warriors,<br>
          &emsp;the Lord scorned them,<br>
          and summoned an army against me<br>
          &emsp;to crush my young men.<br>
          In a winepress my Lord has trodden<br>
          &emsp;virgin Daughter Judah.

          Streaming with tears, my eyes&mdash;<br>
          &emsp;my eyes weep for these things;<br>
          far distant those who might comfort me,<br>
          &emsp;to restore my soul.<br>
          My children all are desolate;<br>
          &emsp;the enemy has prevailed.

          Taut-stretched reach out Zion's hands,<br>
          &emsp;but none comforts her;<br>
          the <span class="yhwh">Lord</span> has summoned against Jacob<br>

          Jerusalem in their midst has become<br>
          &emsp;a thing unclean.

          Upright is the <span class="yhwh">Lord</span>, but I<br>
          &emsp;had defied his command.<br>
          Hear, I pray, all you peoples,<br>
          &emsp;and look on my pain:<br>
          all my young men and maidens<br>
          &emsp;hauled off into exile.

          Vainly I called to my lovers<br>
          &emsp;but all deceived me.<br>
          In the city my priests and my elders<br>
          &emsp;went hungry and perished<br>
          when they searched for food to revive<br>
          &emsp;their failing souls.

          Witness, O <span class="yhwh">Lord</span>, my distress!<br>
          &emsp;My stomach churns,<br>
          my heart recoils within me:<br>
          &emsp;grievously I rebelled.<br>
          Outside the sword bereaves;<br>
          &emsp;inside, too, death.

        <p>
          Yearnings of anguish they heard,<br>
          &emsp;but none brings me comfort.<br>
          My enemies heard that distress<br>
          &emsp;and rejoiced that you caused it.<br>
          Oh, bring on the day you announced&mdash;<br>
          &emsp;let them be as me!

          Zero in on all their evil;<br>
          &emsp;torment them in their turn,<br>
          as you had tormented me<br>
          &emsp;for all my rebellions.<br>
          My groans are many;<br>
          &emsp;my heart is sick.
