    <h1>Lamentations 1</h1>

    ?>

    <p>
      Throughout chapters one, two and four, Zion is not only the dwelling-place of God
      but is additionally personified by the hauntingly endearing term "Daughter Zion".
      The poems lament not merely an inanimate city;
      the city is a precious daughter, beloved of God.<?php
          Footnote('Adelman, Rachel (2021).  <a href="https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/daughter-zion-bat-tzion" target="_blank"><cite>Daughter Zion (Bat Tzion)</cite></a> Shalvi/Hyman Encyclopedia of Jewish Women.');
          Footnote('Berlin (2004), pp.10&ndash;12');
          ?>
      This is set out within the very first verse.
    </p>

    <p>
      Observe that this first poem is in two "voices": a witness-bystander recites most of 1&ndash;11<i>b</i>; the city herself recites most of 11<i>c</i>&ndash;22.  In each, though, the voice of the other occasionally appears (e.g. 9<i>c</i>; 17).
    </p>

    <p>
      Observe, too, the frequency of the word "all"<?php Footnote('Goldingay (2022), pp.11, 41'); ?> and its alignment with the book's theme of the totality of the devastion and suffering.
    </p>

    <p>
      Reminder: the 3&ndash;2 "qinah" rhythm is vitally important to recitation and reading.
