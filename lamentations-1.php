    <h1>Lamentations 1</h1>

    <?php
      include('chapter-links.php');
    ?>

    <p>
      Throughout chapters one, two and four, Zion is not only the dwelling-place of God
      but is additionally personified by the hauntingly endearing term "Daughter Zion" and variants such as "Daughter Jerusalem" and "my Daughter People".
      The poems lament not merely an inanimate city;
      the city is a precious daughter, beloved of God.<?php
          Footnote('Adelman (2021); Berlin (2004), pp.10&ndash;12');
          ?>
      This is set out within the very first verse.
    </p>

    <p>
      Further, in this first poem all the cited human suffering is connected to, and filtered through, the persona of the city, from "<em>her</em> priests groan" (v4) through to "<em>my</em> priests and <em>my</em> elders perish" (v19).<?php Footnote('Dobbs-Allsopp (2012), p.62'); ?>
    </p>

    <p>
      Observe that this first poem is in two "voices": a witness-bystander recites most of 1&ndash;11<i>b</i>; the city herself recites most of 11<i>c</i>&ndash;22.  In each, though, the voice of the other occasionally appears, indeed, interrupts:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The witness's section 8&ndash;10 about the city's accused sin and violation is briefly interrupted midway, 9<i>c</i>, by Jerusalem herself.
      </li>
      <li>
        At 1:17 the witness interjects a brief observation at a pause or turning point in the city's speech.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Observe, too, the frequency of the word "all"<?php Footnote('Goldingay (2022), pp.11, 41'); ?> and its alignment with, indeed establishment of, the book's theme of the totality of the devastion and suffering&mdash;a totality given visual expression to the reader by the end-to-end <span class="acrostic-letter">A</span>-to-<span class="acrostic-letter">Z</span> alphabetic acrostic.
    </p>

    <p>
      Reminder: the 3&ndash;2 <i>qinah</i> rhythm is vitally important to recitation and reading.
      <span class="noprint">
        For an example, hover the mouse over the opening "Alas!&nbsp;&hellip;" verse.
