    <h1>Lamentations 1</h1>

    <?php
      include('chapter-links.php');
    ?>

    <p>
      Throughout chapters one, two and four, Zion is not only the dwelling-place of God
      but is additionally personified by the hauntingly endearing term "Daughter Zion" and variants such as "Daughter Jerusalem" and "my Daughter People".
      The poems lament not merely an inanimate city;
      the city is a precious daughter, beloved of God.<?php
          Footnote('Adelman (2021); Berlin (2004), pp.10&ndash;12.');
          ?>
      This is set out within the very first verse.
    </p>

    <p>
      Further, in this first poem all the cited human suffering is connected to, and filtered through, the persona of the city, from "<em>her</em> priests groan" (v4) through to "<em>my</em> priests and <em>my</em> elders perish" (v19).<?php Footnote('Dobbs-Allsopp (2012), p.62.'); ?>
    </p>

    <p>
      Observe that this first poem is in two "voices": a witness-narrator recites most of 1&ndash;11<i>b</i>; the city herself recites most of 11<i>c</i>&ndash;22.  In each, though, the voice of the other occasionally appears, indeed, interrupts:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The witness's section 7&ndash;10 about the city's accused sin and violation is briefly interrupted at 9<i>c</i> by Jerusalem herself.
      </li>
      <li>
        At 1:17 the witness interjects a brief observation at a pause or turning point in the city's speech.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Section 7&ndash;10 is clearly female-intimate
      and the language heaps up with innuendo.
      Yet it contains a deep and unsettling ambiguity
      which has a significant bearing on how we receive it.
      At first sight, the section is strongly suggestive of Daughter Zion
      having been wilfully unfaithful and wantonly adulterous,
      including the accusation of "sin" (v8).<?php
        Footnote('Several other linguistic resonances and wordplays across the whole chapter
          lead the surface reading in this direction.');
      ?>
      Yet in contrast with forcefully direct language in the
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/biblical-literature/The-Nevi-im-Prophets" target="_blank">Latter Prophets</a>
      (Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the twelve minor prophets)
      the language of the Lamentations poet is non-specific:
      she is never here accused of "adultery" or "whoring".<?php
        Footnote('Dobbs-Allsopp (2012), p.64.');
      ?>
      And a totally different thread also emerges from behind this:
      that of victim of sexual defilement and rape,
      aligned with many other Lamentations passages
      focussed on the abuse and violation of the innocent.
      Both threads, adulteress and rape victim, are co-existing possibilities.
      For us as readers, indeed as disciples and worshippers,
      inhabiting the poetic and disturbing both/and is more valuable
      than rushing into a falsely simplistic either/or.
      The reader is referred to Dobbs-Allsopp (2012), pp.63&ndash;67
      and Hens-Piazza (2017), pp.8&ndash;18.
    </p>

    <p>
      Observe, too, the frequency of the word "all"<?php Footnote('Goldingay (2022), pp.11, 41.'); ?> and its alignment with, indeed establishment of, the book's theme of the totality of the devastion and suffering&mdash;a totality given visual expression to the reader by the end-to-end <span class="acrostic-letter">A</span>-to-<span class="acrostic-letter">Z</span> alphabetic acrostic.
    </p>

    <p>
      Reminder: the 3&ndash;2 <i>qinah</i> rhythm is vitally important to recitation and reading.
      <span class="noprint">
        For an example, hover the mouse over the opening "Alas!&nbsp;&hellip;" verse.

<!-- enemy; foe
     Two different words in use.
     There doesn't seem to be a significant difference.
     Verses: 2, 5, 7, 9, 10, 16, 17, 21.
     Nevertheless we try to respect the original.
     We let the E-acrostic at v5 decide on "enemy" to open it.
     This couplet has both words so makes a good baseline for tracking usage.

       Goldingay/Young:enemy:     Berlin:enemy  Sefaria:foe    Lee:foe
