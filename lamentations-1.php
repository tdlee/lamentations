    <p>
      Throughout chapters one, two and four, Zion is not only dwelling-place of God
      but is additionally personified by the hauntingly endearing term "Daughter Zion".
      The poems lament not merely an inamimate city;
      the city is a precious daughter, beloved of God.<?php
          Footnote('Adelman, Rachel (2021).  <a href="https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/daughter-zion-bat-tzion" target="_blank"><cite>Daughter Zion (Bat Tzion)</cite></a> Shalvi/Hyman Encyclopedia of Jewish Women.');
          ?>
      This is set out within the very first verse.
    </p>

    <p>
      Observe that this first poem is in two "voices": a witness-bystander recites most of 1&ndash;11<i>b</i>; the city herself recites most of 11<i>c</i>&ndash;22.  In each, though, the voice of the other occasionally appears (e.g. 9<i>c</i>; 17).

        Reminder: "qinah" rhythm is vitally important to recitation and reading.
        Each line-pair has three then two strong beats.
        For an example, hover the mouse over the opening "Alas!&nbsp;..." verse.
