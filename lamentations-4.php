    <h1>Lamentations 4</h1>

    <?php
      include('chapter-links.php');
    ?>

    <p>
      The opening "Alas!" recalls the first two poems;
      it is swiftly reinforced in the second half of v2.
    </p>

    <p>
      As with all three preceding poems, this, too, can work as two voices,
      although here as first-person singular (most) and first-person plural (17&ndash;20 or 17&ndash;22).<?php
        Footnote('For 17&ndash;20 see Goldingay (2022), p.163 and Provan (2016), p.109; for 17&ndash;22 see Middlemas (2021), p.25.');
      ?>
      Unlike them, however, the personalised perspective is neither female (as in Lam.1 and 2) nor male (Lam.3),
      but rather various groups within the population.
      And whereas the addressee in 1 and 3 had been the <span class="yhwh">Lord</span>,
      and in 2 had been mostly the city,
      here there is no specific addressee until the personified cities in the closing verses.
    </p>

    <p>
      Visually, a unique aspect of this chapter is the striking use of colour
      in the opening eight verses and its erasure as the degradation of the siege takes hold.<?php Footnote('Berlin (2004), p.103.'); ?>
    </p>

    <p>
      It starts with the impossible.
      Pure gold cannot tarnish under normal circumstances.<?php
        Footnote('Any tarnishing we perceive is not of the gold itself, but of small amounts of other embedded metal impurities.');
      ?>
      Yet here it does.
      The city, temple and king had been believed to be safe under the <span class="yhwh">Lord</span>'s protection;
      defeat and devastation were unthinkable.
      Yet here all this can fall, and does.<?php Footnote('Berman (2023), p.129.'); ?>
      Things are so bad that even nature, God's own created order, is out of kilter.
      And it continues into the human realm,
      including the horror of mothers cannibalising their own God-given children.
      "Blessings of the covenant become human carnage."<?php
        Footnote('Hens-Piazza (2017), p.60.');
      ?>
    </p>

    <p>
      From an inner-biblical perspective, just as the opening verses of Lam.3
      seem to pull in tension against Psalm&nbsp;23,
      so here v4 contrasts with Psalm&nbsp;131
      and v16 with Numbers&nbsp;6:24&ndash;26.<?php
        Footnote('Goldingay (2022), p.179.');
      ?>
      <span class="noprint">
        (Hover the mouse over these verses to see those contrasting texts.)
      </span>
      And the rare term "children [sons] of Zion" leads us to Psalm&nbsp;149:2<?php
        Footnote('Goldingay (2022), p.168; Berman (2023), p.130.');
      ?>
      which in turn draws us to contrast this chapter overall with themes in that psalm.
