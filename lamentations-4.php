      Unlike them, however, the personalised perspective is neither female (as in Lam.1 and 2) nor male (Lam.3),
      but rather various groups within the population.
      And whereas the addressee in 1 and 3 had been the <span class="yhwh">Lord</span>,
      and in 2 had been mostly the city,
      here there is no specific addressee until the personified cities in the closing verses.

      While the narration of 1&ndash;16 is predominantly observational
      of the inhabitants ("my Daughter People")
      it is punctuated at three places, vv.6, 11 and 16,
      by theological reflection and interpretation
      of perhaps an over-reliance on Zion theology.<?php

      Things are so bad that even nature, God's own created order, is out of kilter.
      And it continues into the human realm,

      From an inner-biblical perspective, just as the opening verses of Lam.3
      seem to pull in tension against Psalm&nbsp;23,
      so here are other contrasts, and even overturnings of other passages:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
         v2: the rare term "children [sons] of Zion" leads us to <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+149%3A2&version=NRSVUE" target="_blank">Psalm&nbsp;149:2</a><?php
          Footnote('Goldingay (2022), p.168; Berman (2023), p.130.');
        ?>
        which in turn draws us to contrast this chapter overall with themes in that psalm
      </li>
      <li>
        v4: contrast with <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+131&version=NRSVUE" target="_blank">Psalm&nbsp;131</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        v12: seems almost a parody of <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+48%3A4-8&version=NRSVUE" target="_blank">Psalm&nbsp;48:4&ndash;8</a><?php
          Footnote('Berman (2023), p.134.');
        ?>
      </li>
      <li>
        v16: contrast with <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=numbers+6%3A24-26&version=NRSVUE" target="_blank">Numbers&nbsp;6:24&ndash;26</a><?php

        vv1&ndash;8 (in particular 1&ndash;2, 5, 7&ndash;8): contrast the degrading colour imagery against <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Song%20of%20Songs%205:10-16&version=NRSVUE" target="_blank">Song of Songs&nbsp;5:10&ndash;16</a><?php
