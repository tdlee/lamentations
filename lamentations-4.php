    <h1>Lamentations 4</h1>

    <?php

    <p>
      The opening "Alas!" recalls the first two poems;
      it is swiftly reinforced in the second half of v2.
    </p>

    <p>
      As with all three preceding poems, this, too, can work as two voices,
      although here as first-person singular (most) and first-person plural (17&ndash;20).
      Unlike them, however, the personalised perspective is neither female (as in Lam.1 and 2) nor male (Lam.3),
      but rather various groups within the population.
      And whereas the addressee in 1 and 3 had been the <span class="yhwh">Lord</span>,
      and in 2 had been mostly the city,
      here there is no specific addressee until the personified cities in the closing verses.
    </p>

    <p>
      It starts with the impossible.
      Pure gold does not, and cannot, tarnish under normal circumstances.<?php
        Footnote('The tarnishing we perceive is not of the gold itself, but of small amounts of other embedded metal impurities.');
      ?>
      Yet here it does.
      Things are so bad that even nature, God's own created order, is out of kilter.
      And it continues into the human realm,
      including the horror of mothers cannibalising their own God-given children.
      "Blessings of the covenant become human carnage."<?php
        Footnote('Hens-Piazza, Gina (2017) "Lamentations", p.60. 978-0814681541');
