    <p>
      Lamentations 3 takes the acrostic nature of these poems a step further than the others.
      Here, not only do we have the twenty-two stanzas
      corresponding to successive letters of the Hebrew alphabet,
      but each stanza itself has three lines, each with the same initial letter.
      To achieve the all-embracing "A to Z" of completeness, we omit J, K, Q and&nbsp;X.
    </p>

    <p>
      In contrast to the first and second poems which are voiced by Daughter Zion
      and reflect a woman's perspective of the effects of war and siege,
      this poem is strongly masculine in perspective.
      Indeed its opening words would be best translated as "I am the man",
      from the gender-specific Hebrew "geber"
      (unlike, say, "adam" which can sometimes be read in gender non-specific ways).

      Some see in this chapter's first six verses a sort of "anti-psalm"
      to the well-known Psalm 23 "The <span class="yhwh">Lord</span> is my shepherd".

<div title="Contrast 1-6 with Psalm 23:

  The Lord is my shepherd;
    there is nothing I lack.

  In green pastures he makes me lie down;
    to still waters he leads me;
    he restores my soul.

  He guides me along right paths
    for the sake of his name.

  Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
    I will fear no evil, for you are with me;
    your rod and your staff comfort me.

  You set a table before me
    in front of my enemies;
  You anoint my head with oil;
    my cup overflows.

  Indeed, goodness and mercy will pursue me
    all the days of my life;
  I will dwell in the house of the Lord
    for endless days."

<!--
At this point we have to think about which four letters (of the 26-letter alphabet) to omit.

Q and X are obvious candidates.  Remember, we must keep Z.

The next stanza in many English translations is three lines of "Let".
Perhaps this offers us the easy way out: omit J and K.
