    <h1>Lamentations 3</h1>

    <?php
      include('chapter-links.php');
    ?>

    <p>
      Lamentations 3 takes the acrostic nature of these poems a step further than the others.
      Not only do we have the twenty-two stanzas
      corresponding to the Hebrew alphabet,
      but each stanza itself has three lines sharing that same initial letter.
    </p>

    <p>
      In contrast to the first and second poems which are voiced by Daughter Zion
      and reflect a woman's perspective of the effects of war and siege,
      this poem is strongly masculine in perspective.
      Indeed its opening words would be best translated as "I am the man",
      from the gender-specific Hebrew "geber"
      (unlike, say, "adam" which can sometimes be read in gender-inclusive ways).
    </p>

    <p>
      Like the earlier two poems, this can also be seen as being in two "voices":
      an individual (1&ndash;24 and 40&ndash;66) and a narrator (25&ndash;39).
    </p>

    <p>
      Some see in this chapter's first six verses a sort of "anti-psalm"
      to the well-known Psalm 23 "The <span class="yhwh">Lord</span> is my shepherd".

<div title="Contrast 1-6 with Psalm 23:

  The Lord is my shepherd;
    there is nothing I lack.

  In green pastures he makes me lie down;
    to still waters he leads me;
    he restores my soul.

  He guides me along right paths
    for the sake of his name.

  Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
    I will fear no evil, for you are with me;
    your rod and your staff comfort me.

  You set a table before me
    in front of my enemies;
  You anoint my head with oil;
    my cup overflows.

  Indeed, goodness and mercy will pursue me
    all the days of my life;
  I will dwell in the house of the Lord
    for endless days."

          <sup>[1]</sup>Translation compromise.
            Ideally this would start "I am the man" but the acrostic constraint doesn't allow this.
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>[2]</sup>This section of first person narrative concludes with three references to the self, before the narrative switches to a third person perspective.
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>[3]</sup>In this 'I' stanza, each line shares an opening Hebrew word meaning "good".
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>[4]</sup>"Lie" is the same verb as 1:1&mdash;"Alone lies the city".
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>[5]</sup>The three lines of this stanza all begin with verbs; lines two and three share the same one that can mean put, give or offer.
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>[6]</sup>As with the "I" stanza, the lines here should all start with the same word.  Unfortunately this is a challenge too far.  The Hebrew word is a little anacrusis meaning "for&hellip;" ("because&hellip;").  There seems no such word in English.  Nor does there seem any other reasonable common word across the three lines. Had this stanza been "N" rather than "M", "now" would have been a possibility.  But that would later require a stanza of three "Q" or "X" words.
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>[7]</sup>The verb "rejected" can be seen as anticpating its recurrence at 5:22, the devasting final verse of the enitre book.
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>[8]</sup>Verses 47&ndash;48 involve alliteration and the repetition of 'holocaust'. Further, the final part of 48 is the same as 2:11.
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>[9]</sup>It is unclear whether this direct repetition from the end of the previous verse
            was a deliberate reinforcement ("epiphora") or an inadvertent scribal duplication.
