    <h1>Lamentations 3</h1>

    <?php
      include('chapter-links.php');
    ?>

    <p>
      Lamentations 3 takes the acrostic nature of these poems a step further than the others.
      Not only do we have the twenty-two stanzas
      corresponding to the Hebrew alphabet,
      but each stanza itself has three lines sharing that same initial letter.
    </p>

    <p>
      In contrast to the first and second poems which are voiced by Daughter Zion
      and reflect a woman's perspective of the effects of war and siege,
      this poem is strongly masculine in perspective.
      Indeed its opening words would be best translated as "I am the man",
      from the male-specific Hebrew <em>geber</em>.<?php
        Footnote('Contrast the Hebrew <em>adam</em> which, rather like the English word "man",
          is not only the male "Adam" in the Gen.2 Adam and Eve creation story,
          but can sometimes be read in gender-inclusive manner
          as in the "mankind/<em>adam</em>&hellip;male and female [God] created them"
          in the preceding Gen.1 creation story.');
      ?>
      This recurs in verses 27, 35 and 39.<?php Footnote('Middlemas (2021), p.45.'); ?>
    </p>

    <p>
      Structurally, while the acrostic tends to produce its own grouping
      <em>within</em> acrostic boundaries,
      observe how particular thoughts may have their own
      counter-grouping cutting <em>across</em> these boundaries.
      An early, clear example is at 12&ndash;13 where the bow-and-arrow
      crosses the D/E acrostic boundary.
      This "enjambment" of ideas and images across the alphabetic boundaries
      is a counterweight to the formal structuring of the acrostic,
      and this keeps the poem moving forwards.<?php Footnote('Berlin (2004), p.85.'); ?>
      See also 3&ndash;4, 15&ndash;16, 42&ndash;44, 45&ndash;47 and 48&ndash;51.
      A similar change of thought happens between 58 and 59 within the 'W' stanza.
    </p>

    <p>
      And it is <em>within</em> a single verse, at 42,
      that perhaps the most abrupt change of direction happens.
      Just when the poet is on the brink of regaining his confidence,
      the vision of fragile hope is shattered and evaporates:
      "<em>But you did not forgive</em>".
      Like a thunderbolt from a clear blue sky,
      scything through the verse
      and cutting apart the established Deuteronomic pattern of "we repent; God will forgive":
      "<em>But you did not forgive</em>".<?php
        Footnote('Respectively: Dobbs-Allsopp (1997), p.48; Hens-Piazza (2017), p.52. Also O\'Connor (2002), p.53.');
      ?>
      This may be the most disturbing idea in the chapter, and in the entire book.<?php
        Footnote('Berlin (2004), p.96.');
      ?>
    </p>

          Voices
        </div>

        <p>
          Like the earlier two poems, this may also be seen as being in two primary "voices":
          an individual <em>geber</em> (1&ndash;24 and 40&ndash;66) and a narrator (25&ndash;39).<?php Footnote('Goldingay (2022), p.123. But Hens-Piazza (2017), p.39 sees just one voice throughout.'); ?>
          Or, using a slightly different break-point, 22&ndash;39 may be viewed as a "Wisdom" section, reflecting on the nature of God.<?php Footnote('Berlin (2004), p.92.'); ?>
          That said, it might be noticed that the voice in 40&ndash;47 is in plural, communal form.<?php
            Footnote('Goldingay (2022), p.150; Dobbs-Allsopp (1997), p.41.');
          ?>
        </p>

        <p>
          But is the solo speaker of 52&ndash;66 necessarily the <em>geber</em> of the opening?
          The content is quite different.
          There is a long rabbinic tradition of construing the speaker here as "Bat-Ami":
          a representative of the city, although not Daughter Zion herself.<?php
            Footnote('Berman (2023), pp.114&ndash;116.');
          ?>
        </p>

    <p>
      There are many,
      especially in my own tradition,
      the protestant regions of the western Christian faith,
      who magnify and exalt the hopeful passage of 3:22&ndash;39,
      even to the point of hermetically isolating it from the stark images of the rest of the poems;
      we tend to attach notions such as "central", "focus" and "highlight"
      to verses in this small passage in this third chapter.
      But it seems useful, verging on essential,
      to recognise that this
      "grand statement of hope stands at the centre of the work as a whole
      <em>but not as the focal point</em> [emphasis mine]
      because it exists in tension
      with the portraits of human suffering&hellip;in
      the more negative images of the material."<?php Footnote('Middlemas (2004), p.94.'); ?>
      So if we really want a retain the notion of a single point of highlight,
      then we should instead look to the fifth, final chapter as most important,
      whose communal voice, singly expressed, plays a vital role.<?php Footnote('Kang &amp; Venter (2009), p.2.'); ?>
    </p>

    <p>
      As if to support this,
      "there are a number of places in 3:25&ndash;39
      where the [Hebrew] syntax is convoluted and even problematic.&hellip;
      One effect&hellip;is
      to disrupt&hellip;the ease and forthrightness
      of the poetry's meaning at this point,
      to slow down the reading process
      and to require our closer attention.
      Dissonance thus enters the poetry's message"<?php
        Footnote('Dobbs-Allsopp (2012), pp.120&ndash;121; Dobbs-Allsopp (2023), p.240.');
      ?>
      at precisely the solitary point where hope is expressed.
      The syntax of this new version attempts to reflect this.
      Similarly, the intensely ordered form of the triple acrostic in the man's outward speech
      is strikingly at odds with the ambiguity riddling his interior response.<?php
        Footnote('Hens-Piazza (2017), p.40.');
      ?>
    </p>

    <p>
      Several commentators see in the first few verses a sort of "anti-psalm"
      to the well-known Psalm&nbsp;23, "The <span class="yhwh">Lord</span> is my shepherd".<?php

  He guides me along right paths
    for the sake of his name.

  Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
    I will fear no evil, for you are with me;
    your rod and your staff comfort me.

  You set a table before me
