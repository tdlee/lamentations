<!--
    <p>
    Bible translation, quite rightly, lays great emphasis on capturing meaning of a text
    and of the words that comprise it.
    Within this, there is a range of activity, often characterised as
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_and_formal_equivalence" target="_blank">dynamic and formal equivalence</a>.

    </p>
    <p>
    Near one end of the spectrum, some translations focus on the meanings of individual words.
    To a first (and very rough) approximation, this can be akin to "cookbook translation by dictionary lookup",
    sprinkled with just sufficient syntactic sugar and lexical seasoning to make it readable in
    the target language.
    This is sometimes called "formal equivalence".
    The classic studying translations tend this way: KJV, RSV, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
    Towards the other end of the spectrum can be a focus on what a more large-scale phrase or full sentence
    meant in its original time and context, then re-presenting that overall phrase or sentence
    in the target language and culture.
    This is sometimes called "dynamic equivalence".
    Examples are "The Living Bible" and "The Message".

    <h2>So why this new version?</h2>

    <p>
    <i>Lamentations is poetry. Not prose.</i>
    </p>
-->

    <p>
      Arid brutality and vicious harshness
      are the hallmarks
      of both the text and message of Lamentations.
      Despite that, many English translations
      persist in deploying linguistic styles redolent
      of a gentle ramble through flowery meadows
      on an English summer's day
      in the company of pastoral poet William Wordsworth
      if he had accidentally brushed against a stinging nettle while picking one of his beloved daffodils.
    </p>

    <p>
      Contrast this traditional translation of Lam.&nbsp;3:1&ndash;3 (New English Bible):
    </p>
    <div class="panel panel--width-25em">
      <!-- specifically not "poem_hebverse": NEB lacks even alternating indentation -->
      <div class="poem">

          I have felt the rod of his wrath.<br>
          It was I whom he led away and left to walk<br>
          in darkness, where no light is.<br>
          Against me alone he has turned his hand<br>
          and so it is all day long.<br>
        </p>
      </div><!-- "poem" -->
    </div><!-- "panel" -->
    <p>
      with the beat-driven, rhythmical version freshly offered here:

      <div class="poem poem__hebverse">
        <p>

    <h2>Can scripture be "performance poetry"?</h2>

    <p>
    Yes!  See the Psalms.  But even more so, Lamentations.
    Lamentations leaps into life when released from
    the bondage of our preconceptions.
    </p>

    <p>
    Might our reading of scripture risk actually stifling it?
    We sit in comfortable chairs. We are silent.
    We smother it under a prose-shaped bias that pre-disposes our expectations:
    the earnest, spiritual quest for "the meaning".
    And we then, subconsciously, expect scripture to conform and behave
    in accordance with our pre-formed expectation of our "meaning".
    </p>
    <p>
    But <em>this</em> version aims to <em>demand</em> us
    leap up and perform it aloud.
    </p>

    <p>
    Poetry is far, far more than its mere component words and phrases.
    Prose often (not always, of course) attempts to tie down meaning to a particular intent.
    </p>

    <p>
    By contrast to this "pinning down" of prose,
    the very form and nature of poetry can take us in the opposite direction:
    the act of performing it opens out the edges of meaning; it invites and encourages the reader to explore an open landscape.
    </p>

    <p>
    Poetry through the ages deploys a range of techniques.
    There is rhyme.  Metre.  Alliteration.
    Even the physical feel of aloud-spoken words in the mouth plays a part.
    </p>

    <p>
    Lamentations also has the acrostic, discarded in most translations.
    But perhaps even more important,
    and also jettisoned in most translations,
    is a forceful, angst-driven rhythm, known as 'qinah'.
    </p>

    <h3>Qinah&hellip;</h3>

    <p>
    <i>Lamentations is poetry. Not prose.</i>
    </p>

    <p>
    Declaim it aloud!
    Vital to the Hebrew verse of Lamentations is its three&ndash;two <i>qinah</i> stress pattern pervading all but the final chapter.
    Hebrew poetry can be tightly concise compared to English equivalents
    which tend to wax more loquaciously expansive.
    This version aims for that original tight conciseness.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hit those stresses.  This is rap.  This is beat.
      Or, in more refined society,
      "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprung_rhythm" target="_blank">sprung rhythm</a> with attitude".
    </p>

    <div class="panel panel--width-26em">
      <div class="poem">
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<strong>Ag</strong>onies:&emsp;&emsp;<strong>I</strong> am the man <strong>seared</strong><br>

    <p>
    And we might observe that the overall "3+2" count of the line matches the pentameter, so familiar in English poetry.
    </p>

    <p>
    It is sadly rare for an English translation
    to capture this condensed rhythmic vitality
    of the scriptural text.
    Admirers of the translation by
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Alter" target="_blank">Robert Alter</a> will know
    his work to capture it;
    see, for example, his Psalm&nbsp;29 and Genesis&nbsp;1.
    Also notable is the
    <a href="http://www.usccb.org/bible/" target="_blank">New American Bible Revised Edition (NABRE)</a>;
    see their <a href="http://www.usccb.org/bible/lamentations/0" target="_blank">Introduction to Lamentations</a>
    and their <a href="http://www.usccb.org/bible/lamentations/1" target="_blank">online translation</a>.
    By coming to such texts from the poetic angle, some of this can be regained.
    </p>
    <p>
    I thoroughly recommend these translations.
    But note that both had other constraints which ruled against using acrostics.
    </p>

    <div class="widthclear"></div>

    <h3>&hellip;and acrostics</h3>

        <div class="poem poem__linewrap poem--acrostic">
          <p>Acrostics are alphabetical texts.</p>
          <p>Bible scholars disagree on their purpose.</p>
          <p>Consequently, translations differ.</p>
          <p>Despite differences in emphasis,</p>
          <p>Every translator acknowledges that</p>
          <p>Form and meaning are connected.</p>
          <p>Given the strictures of acrostics, however,</p>
          <p>Holding on to both is impossible.</p>
          <p>If the acrostic in a poem is</p>
          <p>Just an ornament or aid to memory,</p>
          <p>Keeping it intact is not necessary.</p>
          <p>Leave it with the detritus of translation.</p>
          <p>Meaning is what matters.</p>
          <p>Nothing has been lost.</p>
          <p>Or has it? Some critics say</p>
          <p>Poetry is a unique wedding of form and meaning,</p>
          <p>Quite different from artless prose.</p>
          <p>Rather than being mere bangle,</p>
          <p>Structure is meaning.</p>
          <p>Translations must convey this unity.</p>
          <p>Unable to mirror the original exactly,</p>
          <p>Versions must choose which aspect to favor.</p>
          <p>Whatever they do, though,</p>
          <p>Xerography is not one of the choices.</p>
          <p>You try: Is <i>alpha</i> to <i>omega</i> "<i>A</i>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<i>O</i>" or "<i>A</i>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<span class="acrostic-letter"><i>Z</i></span>"?</p>

    <i>Lamentations is poetry. Not prose.</i>
    </p>

    <p>
    Several psalms use the technique of acrostics in the Hebrew alphabet of 22 letters.
    Many of us may already be familiar with this, lurking, but usually ignored by us, in the background.
    </p>

    <p>
    In the Lamentations anthology of five poems, four are Hebrew-acrostic
    and the third of these is even triple acrostic:
    </p>

    <div class="panel panel--width-17em">
      <div class="poem poem__linewrap poem--acrostic">
        <p>Agonies: I am&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
        <p>Away he has driven&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
        <p>Against me he turns&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Breaking my bones&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
        <p>Besieged by him&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
        <p>Bound by him&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
      </div><!-- "poem" -->

      <div class="panel__cite">
          &mdash;Lam.&nbsp;3:1&ndash;6
      </div><!-- "panel__cite" -->
    </div><!-- "panel" -->

    <p>
    The final poem, while not Hebrew-acrostic, nevertheless also has 22 stanzas
    and some see a surprising hidden acrostic in its final four stanzas,
    whose principle is also made manifest in this rendering.
    </p>

    <p>
    An aim of this new version is to capture that foundational acrostic technique
    that almost all modern translations lack,
    <a href="http://catholicbible.online/knox/OT/Lam" target="_blank">that of Ronald Knox</a>
    being an exception.<?php
      Footnote('Unfortunately the Knox translation de-regularises the all-important opening \'A\' word of chapters 1, 2 and 4. These ought to be consistently "Alas" or equivalent but instead become the inconsistent set "Alone", "Alas" and "All".');
    ?>
    </p>

    <p>
    In his magesterial translation of the Hebrew Bible,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Alter" target="_blank">Robert Alter</a> notes:
<i>"This [acrostic] form leads to even more syntactic inversions than is common in biblical Hebrew,
    with the object of the verb 'fronted' at the beginning of many lines,
    but the poet exploits this pattern for expressive emphasis."</i><?php
      Footnote('Alter, Robert (2019) "The Hebrew Bible: Volume 3: The Writings", footnote to Lam.&nbsp;3:1. p.657. 978-0-393-29249-7');
    ?>
    Again, a prose-biased quest for "meaning" might miss this.
    But it can come across with authentic power in the poem,
    including in English translation or paraphrase.
    </p>

    <p>
    In mapping Hebrew's 22 letters onto the western alphabet's 26,
    four letters need omitting.<?php
      Footnote('The further subtlety of two different versions of the Hebrew alphabet having
        a reversal of two of its letters, with some chapters using one and some the other,
        is deemed a geek-fest too far for this particular exercise.');
    ?>
    Knox chose to omit the final four: W&ndash;Z.
    But an appeal of alphabetic-acrostic poetry is its all-encompassing
    "A&nbsp;to&nbsp;Z" sense of totality:
    in the case of the people of Lamentations, the totality of the destruction of their beloved Jerusalem;
    the <span class="acrostic-letter">A</span>nnihilation of <span class="acrostic-letter">Z</span>ion.
    Indeed, the text of the second poem is itself book-ended, "A&nbsp;to&nbsp;Z" style,
    by "the day of the <span class="yhwh">Lord</span>'s anger".
    </p>
    <p>
    So isn't this "aleph to tav", "A&nbsp;to&nbsp;Z" totality equally valid as an integral,
    even essential, component of "meaning"?
    Whatever necessary four letters are chosen for omission,
    "A" and "Z" surely remain indispensable.
    </p>

    <div class="widthclear"></div>

    <h2>In summary</h2>
    <p>
    So why this version?
    No existing version seems to capture the essential characteristics
    of the original Hebrew: Z-inclusive acrostic; qinah; linguistic compactness.
    </p>
    <p>
    Perform it aloud!
    </p>
    <p>
    See the visual acrostic; speak that 'qinah'.
